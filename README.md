Abstract:

This project aims to develop an integrated online platform that serves as a unified hub for student projects sourced from diverse educational institutions. The platform addresses several critical aspects of project management and collaboration in academia, including plagiarism detection, search and collaboration tools, data privacy and security measures, project idea generation, and project ratings and feedback mechanisms.

The primary objective is to streamline the process of accessing, sharing, and collaborating on student projects across different institutions. The implementation of a robust plagiarism detection system ensures the originality and integrity of submitted projects, fostering academic honesty and intellectual property protection. User-friendly search and collaboration tools facilitate seamless interaction and knowledge exchange among students and educators.

Moreover, stringent data privacy and security measures are implemented to safeguard sensitive project information and user data. The inclusion of a Gen AI feature enhances project ideation by suggesting innovative ideas based on user preferences and trends. Additionally, the platform integrates project rating and feedback mechanisms to enable constructive evaluation and continuous improvement of project quality.
